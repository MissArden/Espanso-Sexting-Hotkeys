## Espanso Sexting Package info


Hi, I'm Miss Arden!

I joined Aaron's chatting team in August 2024 and found our system lacking.

I would often find myself staring at a customer's message, unsure of how to respond. 

There are several different situations that require common responses, and I've tried to identify the major ones here.
